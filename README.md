This project analyzes the Global Landslide Catalog dataset to investigate trends in rainfall-triggered landslide events worldwide. Leveraging Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib, it explores temporal patterns, geographical distributions, and the impact of landslides over time. Through data visualization and statistical analysis, the project aims to uncover insights into landslide occurrences, contributing to better understanding and mitigation of landslide risks globally.

The libraries used in this project are:
1. pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis, especially for handling structured data such as datasets in tabular format.
2. numpy: Utilized for numerical operations on arrays and matrices, providing support for mathematical functions and operations.
3. seaborn: Used for statistical data visualization, providing an interface for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.
4. matplotlib: Employed for creating additional visualizations and plots to explore and present the data effectively, providing fine-grained control over plot 
   customization.
